# Project Neighborhood Map

This is a project for Udacity "Full-stack developer" course.

## Usability

In order to run the application, one must simply run the index.html file in a browser of choice.

## Credits

The application utilizes Foursquare API to get the location's information and the Google Maps Javascript API to render the map.

Thanks.
